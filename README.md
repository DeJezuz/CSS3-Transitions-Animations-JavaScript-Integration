# 🎬 Interactive UI System  
**CSS3 Transitions & JavaScript Functions for Responsive Web Interfaces**

This project demonstrates how to bring static web pages to life using **CSS3 animations** and **modular JavaScript logic**. Developed as part of the PLP Web Technologies classroom assignment (July 2025), it showcases a clean, accessible, and interactive user experience—designed with both performance and empathy in mind.

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Create dynamic visual effects using **CSS transitions and keyframes**
- Build reusable **JavaScript functions** with parameters, return values, and scoped logic
- Seamlessly integrate CSS and JS to trigger animations based on user interaction
- Prioritize **accessibility**, **modularity**, and **user experience**

## 🧩 Features

### ✅ CSS3 Transitions & Animations
- Button hover and active effects with smooth transitions
- Keyframe animations for loaders and pulse feedback
- Modal and box transformations with elegant motion
- Motion-reduction toggle for accessibility-conscious users

### ✅ JavaScript Logic & Scope
- `AnimationController` class encapsulates animation control
- Functions demonstrate scope, parameters, and return values
- Focus trapping inside modal for keyboard navigation
- Escape key listener for intuitive modal dismissal

### ✅ Dynamic Interaction
- Toggle animations via button clicks
- Show/hide modal and loader with reusable JS methods
- Reduce motion preference applied dynamically via checkbox
